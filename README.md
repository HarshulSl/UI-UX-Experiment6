# UI-UX-Experiment6


## Aim:

To design a combined UX scenario that integrates fitness tracking and food delivery into a unified, user-friendly interface, promoting healthy eating habits and overall well-being.

## Algorithm:

Identify User Needs:
Analyze user goals related to health tracking, calorie monitoring, and convenient food ordering.

Design Unified UI:
Create a seamless interface where users can view their health stats and order meals based on dietary preferences.

Integrate Core Features:
Include calorie tracking, personalized meal recommendations, and real-time delivery tracking.

Test & Refine:
Conduct usability testing to improve the clarity of visual cues, navigation, and recommendation accuracy.

Deploy & Monitor:
Launch the prototype, collect user feedback, and enhance recommendations based on behavioral data.


## Output:
### 1. Solution Ideation: Fitness & Food App

#### Method Used: Brainwriting Ideation Exercise

Eight creative ideas were generated to merge health tracking and food ordering:

1.Personalized dashboard showing daily steps, calories, and hydration.

2.“Smart Meal Suggestion” based on calorie goal and diet type.

3.Integration with wearable fitness devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch).

4.Voice-enabled food ordering for hands-free convenience.

5.Filter food by calories, nutrients, and preparation time.

6.AI-based nutrition coach giving daily tips.

7.Instant re-order button for previous healthy meals.

8.Rewards for maintaining daily fitness goals.

### 2. Creating User Stories

Using diverse personas (gym-goer, office worker, homemaker, athlete, diabetic patient), the following stories were created:

| # | User Story                                                                                     |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | As a gym-goer, I want to order high-protein meals so that I can meet my fitness goals.                   |
| 2 | As an office worker, I want quick healthy lunch options so that I can save time during breaks.            |
| 3 | As a homemaker, I want to track family nutrition so that everyone eats balanced meals. |
| 4 | As an athlete, I want to sync my smartwatch data so that I can track calories accurately.    |
| 5 | As a diabetic patient, I want sugar-free meal recommendations so that I can manage my health better.    |

### 3. Creating Scenarios

#### Chosen User Story:

As an office worker, I want quick healthy lunch options so that I can save time during breaks.

Scenario Narrative:
Arun, a 26-year-old software developer, has only 30 minutes for lunch. He opens the “FitEats” app, which displays his calorie intake for the day and suggests three quick, healthy lunch options based on his fitness goal. He chooses a grilled paneer bowl, pays through UPI, and tracks his delivery in real-time. The app even adjusts his daily calorie count automatically after the meal.

Emotional State: Hungry, rushed, then satisfied.

Environment: Office desk during lunch break.

Tasks: Open app → View suggestions → Order meal → Track delivery → Update calorie goal.

### 5. Information Architecture (IA)

Example Application: FitEats App

Method Used: Closed Card Sorting

#### User-Created Categories:

| **Fitness Goals** | Workout Plans, Progress Tracker            |
| **Rewards**       | Achievements, Badges, Redeem Points        |
| **Settings**      | Profile, Notifications, Help, Logout       |


#### Resulting Sitemap Structure:
```
